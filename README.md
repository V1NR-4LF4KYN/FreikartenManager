# FreikartenManager

Manager fÃ¼r Freikarten. 
Love you A <3


This project is for a rather personal use. 
Me and my girlfriend have always called out loud "Schnapszahl" 
everytime the time hit 0000, 1111, or 2222 o' clock.

Soon we came up with rewards for each of us for getting streaks of Freikarten.
For about a year and a half I've been updating it manually and analog.

So now I coded this. Now I just need to run one file, and the computer automatically 
adds to either her or my streak, checks streaks and gives out rewards.

It works in a pretty simple way and I worked on for about two days.
It could be more efficient and probably prettier, but I am quite proud of it and I like it as it is!

Also my first time working with JSON and Files.
